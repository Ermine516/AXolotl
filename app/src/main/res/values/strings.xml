    <string name="help001">Welcome to <b>AXolotl</b> a self-study tool for formal reasoning and Logic.
    The above image displays the start screen when the App is first opened. In order to start using
    AXolotl you can click on the "hamburger" menu <b>☰</b> or the "kebap" menu <b>⋮</b> to choose a
        problem or open a proble. \n\n
    To move onto the section of this tutorial <b>swipe right</b>. If you feel the need to go back to
    an earlier section <b>swipe left</b>. </string>
    <string name="help002">If you choose to click on <b>⋮</b> the above image illustrates
        what you will see on the screen. If you have not started a problem you may click on <b>Load Problem</b>
        to open an AXolotl compatible file. If you have finished your problem you have an option to save the
        proof as a jpeg image by clicking on <b>Save Proof Picture</b> or as a latex file by clicking on
        <b>Save Latex Proof to Clipboard</b>. The other options are probably familiar to you already, namely,
        <b>Help</b> and <b>About</b>. \n\n
    To move onto the section of this tutorial <b>swipe right</b>. If you feel the need to go back to
    an earlier section <b>swipe left</b>. </string>
    <string name="help003">If you choose to click on <b>☰</b> the above image illustrates
        what you will see on the screen. If you have not started a problem, clicking on <b>Problem</b> will
        return you to the initial screen. Normally, clicking on <b>Problem</b> returns you to the problem
        screen which we will see shortly. If you instead click on <b>View Proof</b> you will instead be
        brought to the proof view which is currently empty (unless you have started a problem). The next two
        options in the hamburger menu concern the process of solving a chosen problem. \n\n
          When the AXolotl loads <b>observation mode</b> is activated. This means that AXolotl will provide
        you with all the details of your progress when solving a problem. Once you get use to the interface,
        problem solving, and understand how a given formal system works you may choose to deactivate
        observation mode. In this case AXolotl will only inform you when it requires action from you.
        Concerning <b>Text size</b>, when the AXolotl loads the text size is set to 30sp. You can adjust the
        text size to any size between 10sp and 50sp. The remaining options in the hamburger menu are problem
        list. In particular we will click on <b>Classical logic</b>.\n\n
